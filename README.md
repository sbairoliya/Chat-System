# Chat-System
Our Project is a chat system which utilises intranet connectivity between two terminals, allowing users to communicate via text messages using Turbo C++ as a platform. The users have to enter their user number which is either 1 or 2 and then their names. The chat is a one on one chat with one message being sent at a time.

Moreover, each chat is also stored as separate text files for future reference in a chronological order. The details of the files kept as reference are saved in a binary file. The binary file stores the serial number, date, time, names of the users and the name of the text file for a particular conversation. Users can read previous chats based on date-time enquiries. The program follows a menu driven approach where users can either chat or read chats.
