# Chat-System
Chat System (2018), in collaboration with my friend in which we used a text file shared between two terminals in the network drive. Also stored the chats in a text file based on the date and time of the chat. The record of files was stored in a ‘.dat’ file for further reference.  Took two months. (C++)
